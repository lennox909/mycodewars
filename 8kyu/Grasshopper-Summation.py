#Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

#For example (Input -> Output):

#2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
#8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

# My solution 

def summation(num):
    pass
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        total_sum += i
    return total_sum
